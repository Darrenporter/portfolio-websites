Bread By Josef.<br><br>
		This month we go once more down the healthy road with a loaf which uses fermented grains in our traditional sourdough process. The result? A good low GI option which is even easier to digest with sound nutritional value.

Sprouting grain is a way to make them edible and more digestible without cooking. This process breaks the starch molecules into simple sugars to feed plant growth. Nutrients, vitamins, and minerals stored to nourish plant growth are made more accessible and easier to absorb, making sprouted grains a potential nutritional powerhouse.

Traditional grain breads are harder to digest and nutrients can be lost because our bodies are unable to digest them. Sprouted grain bread is a healthy alternative to your standard loaf of bread as the grain has been broken down and thus the nutrients are more readably absorbed in your body. Rye and wholemeal flours are also less refined which makes this type of bread more filling. Factor in the long fermenting process we always use in our sourdoughs and you have a bread with a very low glycaemic index for those who are sensitive (but not intolerant) to wheat and gluten.

Buckwheat is commonly considered to be a grain but is actually a fruit seed akin to rhubarb; this makes it ideal for those with a low tolerance for wheat and gluten. Buckwheat is high in protein and has one of the highest amino acid scores among plant sources. It is full of nutrients, containing high levels of zinc, copper manganese and magnesium and is also high in soluble fibre helping to slow down the rate of glucose absorption.

Sprouting buckwheat allows for maximum nutrient absorption and massively improves digestion. Allowing time for the buckwheat to ferment in a porridge-like mixture (known as grits) also brings out a potent nutty flavour in the bread.

Junes Sprouted Buckwheat Sourdough is a loaf that ticks a lot of boxes it will leave you feeling less bloated, fuller for longer and with your culinary halo still shining.

Available from Wild Wheat Mt Eden, Howick and Belmont from Tuesday June 2nd onward.

$7.00 for an 800g loaf. <br><br>
