			<p>Franz Josef Glacier is 12km long and fed by a massive 20 square km snowfield at the top of the Southern Alps. It features ice pinnacles as high as multi-story buildings, deep crevasses and stunning, pristine blue ice. Itâ€™s all on show and the most dynamic glacier in New Zealand is accessible to you via one of the most exhilarating experiences in the world.  First witness the majesty of the beautiful ice formation from the air as your helicopter takes to the skies above the glacier.  Then descend onto the glacier itself and set foot on the ice.  Your heli hike guide will then lead you through some of the most stunning ice formations, immersing you in the world of the Franz Josef Glacier.  To touch the ice and breathe in the fresh alpine air is a unique experience and one which you will never forget.<br><br>

			<p>The rugged West Coast of the South Island is an untamed beauty where the mountains meet the Tasman Sea and where rainforests give way to Glaciers.  Nowhere else in the world can glaciers be found in such a dramatic setting, in such close proximity to the Sea, making Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers truly unique. The Helicopter Line operates from both Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier townships with multiple flight options available from each location.<br><br>
